# Abstract

Multisig transactions work by requiring multiple private keys to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed on the Stacks network. For example, a Stacks wallet may require two out of three private keys to be used in order to authorize a transaction. This means that all three parties involved in the transaction must agree to the terms of the transaction and sign off on it before the funds can be moved. Overall, multisig transactions provide an extra layer of security and control over Stacks transactions, making them a valuable tool for anyone looking to protect their funds.

For such transactions to be really flexible and useful for common users, DAOs, dApps, and companies - it is important for signatures to be order-independent. Current restrictions in signature orders prevent multisignature solutions to emerge.

# Frontend signature examples

An example of a random signing order can be found below and the full code in this _[issue](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks.js/issues/1487)_.

```javascript
  const transaction = await makeUnsignedSTXTokenTransfer({
      recipient,
      amount,
      network,
      fee,
      nonce,
      memo,
      numSignatures: 2,
      publicKeys: pubKeyStrings,
    });

  const signer = new TransactionSigner(transaction);
  signer.signOrigin(privKeys[2]);
  signer.appendOrigin(pubKeys[0]);
  signer.signOrigin(privKeys[1]);
```
